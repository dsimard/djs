# djs

Mixing javascript and music to create live-looping in a browser. js is interpreted and played on the fly.
Sounds are created live programmatically. Sound templates are available. All you have is a main loop and
you create your own beat out of it. An event is raised every 10ms. The music can't stop so even if there's an
error, the last successful loop is played. A complete session can be saved and replay exactly as it was
played live. It is programmer and musician friendly.
